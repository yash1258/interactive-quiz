    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Stone, Amber, Slate) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-view, sequential quiz application. It presents one question at a time to maintain focus. Users select an answer and receive immediate, color-coded feedback and a detailed explanation, reinforcing learning. A progress bar provides visual orientation. The flow is linear: question -> answer -> feedback -> next, culminating in a final score summary. This structure was chosen because it directly converts the static source material into an engaging, interactive learning tool that is intuitive and effective for self-assessment. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Multiple-choice questions and answers. Goal: Test user knowledge interactively. Presentation Method: Dynamic HTML text blocks for questions and explanations, HTML buttons for answers. Interaction: User clicks an answer button. JS evaluates the choice, updates button colors (green/red) for immediate feedback, and reveals the explanation text. A 'Next' button controls progression. A simple progress bar (HTML div styled with Tailwind) will visualize progress. Justification: This approach avoids complex visualizations where they aren't needed, focusing on clear presentation and direct interaction, which is the most effective way to handle a quiz. Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for all logic, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                question: "A hockey puck slides on a sheet of frictionless ice at a constant velocity. What is true about the forces acting on the puck?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "There is a constant force in the direction of motion.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The net force on the puck is zero.", correct: true },
                    { text: "The force of gravity is the only force acting on it.", correct: false },
                    { text: "There are no forces acting on the puck at all.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "An object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force (Newton's First Law). Constant velocity means zero acceleration, which implies the net force is zero."
            },
            {
                question: "You are a passenger in a car that suddenly stops. Your body lurches forward. This is a direct demonstration of:",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Newton's Second Law.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Newton's Third Law.", correct: false },

                    { text: "The force of friction.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "Your body has inertia and tends to continue its state of motion. The car stops, but your body continues to move forward until an external force, like a seatbelt, acts on it."
            },
            {
                question: "If you push on a heavy box with a force of 200 N and it does not move, what is the force of static friction?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Greater than 200 N.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Less than 200 N.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Exactly 200 N in the opposite direction.", correct: true },
                    { text: "It depends on the object's mass.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "Since the box is not accelerating (it's at rest), the net force on it must be zero. Therefore, the force of static friction must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to your push."
            },
            {
                question: "A small car and a large truck collide head-on. During the collision, which of the following is true?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "The truck exerts a greater force on the car than the car exerts on the truck.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The car exerts a greater force on the truck than the truck exerts on the car.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The truck and the car exert equal and opposite forces on each other.", correct: true },
                    { text: "The acceleration of both vehicles is the same.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The forces are identical in magnitude. The effects of these forces (accelerations) are different due to the different masses."
            },
            {
                question: "Imagine an astronaut in deep space, far from any gravitational influence, throws a baseball. What will happen to the baseball after it leaves her hand?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "It will travel in a straight line at a constant speed forever.", correct: true },
                    { text: "It will gradually slow down and stop.", correct: false },
                    { text: "It will curve as it runs out of force.", correct: false },
                    { text: "It will travel in a straight line but gradually slow down.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "This is a perfect illustration of Newton's First Law. With no external forces like gravity or air resistance, the baseball's inertia will keep it in its state of motion indefinitely."
            },
            {
                question: "According to Newton's Second Law (F=ma), if you double the net force acting on an object while keeping its mass constant, its acceleration will:",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Be quartered.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Be halved.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Remain the same.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Be doubled.", correct: true }
                ],
                explanation: "Acceleration is directly proportional to the net force. If you double the cause (net force), you double the effect (acceleration)."
            },
            {
                question: "A book is resting on a tabletop. The force of gravity pulls the book down. What is the 'reaction' force according to Newton's Third Law?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "The table pushing up on the book.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The book pushing down on the table.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The book pulling up on the Earth.", correct: true },
                    { text: "The air pressure on top of the book.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "Action-reaction pairs must be of the same type and act on different objects. The Earth exerts a gravitational force on the book, so the book must exert an equal and opposite gravitational force on the Earth."
            },
            {
                question: "You are pulling a sled with a rope at a constant velocity. The rope is at an angle to the horizontal ground. What can you say about the net force on the sled?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "The net force is in the direction you are pulling.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The net force is zero.", correct: true },
                    { text: "The net force is upwards.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The net force is equal to the force of friction.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "The key phrase is 'constant velocity.' An object moving at a constant velocity is not accelerating. According to Newton's First and Second Laws, if acceleration is zero, the net force must also be zero."
            },
            {
                question: "Why is it harder to start pushing a heavy filing cabinet from rest than it is to keep it sliding at a constant velocity?",
                answers: [
                    { text: "The force of gravity is stronger when the object is at rest.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Static friction is generally greater than kinetic friction.", correct: true },
                    { text: "The cabinet's inertia is only present when it is at rest.", correct: false },
                    { text: "The normal force is greater when the object is at rest.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "It takes more force to overcome the initial 'stickiness' (static friction) between two surfaces than it does to keep them sliding against each other once they are in motion (kinetic friction)."
            },
            {
                question: "A rocket accelerates upwards from a launchpad. The upward thrust from the engines is greater than the downward pull of gravity. This is a direct application of:",
                answers: [
                    { text: "Newton's First Law, because the rocket's state of motion is changing.", correct: false },
                    { text: "Newton's Second Law, because there is a net (unbalanced) force causing acceleration.", correct: true },
                    { text: "Newton's Third Law, because the rocket pushes on the gas and the gas pushes on the rocket.", correct: false },
                    { text: "All of the above.", correct: false }
                ],
                explanation: "While the Third Law explains propulsion, the reason the rocket accelerates upwards is due to an unbalanced net force (Thrust > Gravity), as described by Newton's Second Law (F_net = ma)."
